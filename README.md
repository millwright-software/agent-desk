# Agent Desk

**Terminal command center for AI coding agents.**

Run and switch between Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, and other terminal AI tools —
each in its own tmux session — from one keyboard-driven view.

## Install

Requires `tmux`. macOS, Linux, or Windows via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/millwright-software/agent-desk/main/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install</summary>

```bash
go install github.com/millwright-software/agent-desk/cmd/agent-desk@latest   # needs Go 1.24+

git clone https://github.com/millwright-software/agent-desk.git              # from source
cd agent-desk && make install
```

</details>

The app checks for new releases and can update itself. Or re-run the installer.

## Use

```bash
agent-desk                        # launch the TUI
agent-desk add . -c claude        # add the current dir as a Claude session
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Attach to session |
| `Shift+←` / `Shift+→` | Previous / next live session, while attached |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Detach back to the list |
| `n` · `d` | New session · delete |
| `g` · `G` | New group · new top-level group |
| `m` · `e` | Move session to a group · rename group |
| `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` | Move a group or session up/down |
| `Tab` · `1`–`9` | Expand/collapse group · jump to group |
| `?` | Every shortcut |

Each session shows what its agent is doing:

| Status | Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Running | `●` yellow | Actively working |
| Waiting | `●` green | Needs your input |
| Idle | `○` gray | Ready for commands |
| Error | `✕` red | Something went wrong |

Claude sessions read the session hook and transcript, so the status is exact and includes the current model.
Other tools fall back to output patterns and tmux activity.

## Worktrees

Each session can run in its own git worktree and branch.

```bash
agent-desk add . -c claude --worktree feature/a --new-branch
agent-desk worktree finish "My Session"    # merge, remove worktree, delete session
agent-desk worktree cleanup                # remove orphaned worktrees
```

Worktrees go in a sibling directory by default; `[worktree] default_location` in `~/.agent-desk/config.toml`
changes that.

## Tools

| Tool | Support |
|------|---------|
| Claude Code | Status, resume, model detection |
| Gemini CLI | Status, resume |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Status, resume (`--continue`) |
| OpenCode / Codex / Cursor | Status detection |
| Anything else in a terminal | Add it under `[tools.*]` in `config.toml` |
